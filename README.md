Detecting brain tumors early is vital for improving patient outcomes. This project explores the impact of various pre-processing techniques on the classification accuracy of MRI brain tumor images from FigShare, Sartaj, and BR35 H datasets. It highlights the importance of pre-processing by comparing noisy, original, and pre-processed images, with the Total Variation (TV) method showing the best results in noise reduction and achieving the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The study also evaluates machine learning classifiers, including SVM, CNN, Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2, and an ensemble method combining CNN and Transfer Learning. The ensemble model achieves the highest accuracy, demonstrating the significant improvement in classification accuracy due to pre-processing. These findings underscore the critical role of pre-processing in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, especially for early-stage tumor detection, contributing to better patient care and outcomes.
